# Change Divi Templates Programmatically
This pyhton script allows a divi template file to be modified programmatically and create a new template file for each change as set out in the settings.json file. 

How to use: 
 1. Download files to a directory
 2. Replace the template.json file to match your requred temaplate.
 3. Open the settings file and change the values to match the content you need to change. 
 4. Duplicate settings groups as many times as you need and change values to iterate. 
 5. Edit modify_template.py to correspond the values in the settings.json file. *Template title corresponds to the template name shown in the divi library.*
 6. Make sure you have python installed and assigned to path.
 7. Open a CMD instance and run : python modify_template.py
